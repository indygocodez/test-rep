            <div>Stranded With Drama is aiming to be a cartoon parody of Reality TV competitions, whilst also representing different the coming-of-age high schooler experiences of Gen Z. Think if you combined TV shows such as Survivor and Big Brother with shows like Never Have I Ever, Sex Education, or Grand Army and made them a PG-14 Reality TV styled survival competition.</div>
            &nbsp;
            <div>18 teenagers are stranded on an island, in the musty outdoors, with no cell service, vicious wildlife, shitty food, 24/7 cameras, and each other. Over their 2 and a half month stay they’ll have to compete in a variety of rigorous challenges, face the judgment of their fellow contestants, and avoid getting kicked off until only one person is left standing.</div>
            &nbsp;
            <div>But despite the competition, this diverse set of teens learn a lot about themselves and their fellow competitors throughout their stays on the island. Some become friends, some even become lovers, some leave absolutely hating each other, and some won’t even stay long enough to remember everyone’s names. In the end, only one winner will come out on top, which you’ll find out from watching Stranded with Drama!</div>
